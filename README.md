A simple expense/purchases tracking app with a basic input system...
as well as a check purchases in a certain month.

Straightforward use:
On startup, you will see 4 buttons
1) Storing purchases:
2) click "Add Purchases".
3) you will be taken to list of pictures, simply click the return button.(still a work in progress)
4) you will then be taken to page of textfields, the dates will be auto filled, you can fill the rest.
5) then click "Apply Values"
6) and finally; click "Add current values.
And with that we have added a purchase to the database.

1) Checking your purchases.
2) click "Purchases".
3) select the month you wish to check for things bought in that month.
4) then press "Open Purchases".
5) you will be given a list of items bought throughout the month.

Note: the 2 last buttons do nothing yet, they are meant to show the maximum spent and various other statistics... they will available as soon as possible.
