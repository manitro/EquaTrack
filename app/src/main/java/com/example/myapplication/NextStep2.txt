//Instead of trying to use the advanced APIs for retrieving content, let's simply open a fileDir and transfer the images from drawable to the directory.














//In the Add Entry activity, we should take the code and put it into another CustomEntry.kt activity(or keep the code for a popup window)

//...then we add a different code which shows standard pre-defined choices for the purchases (Images for different products/services), and after selecting an image, the price and productName of said image will automatically fill their proper fields.

//Clicking add entry will save the entry along with the photo name in column 6.

//Of course the CustomEntry UI will ask for an image from the phone storage; and that too will be saved to the app storage and added to column 6.
